 * Determine the operating system command or procedure provided by your computer to display the 
 * contents of a saved file. Compare its operation with the program developed for exercise 1c.
 * (Hint: In keyboard-driven operating systems, such as DOS and Unix, the operating system 
 * command is typically dir, list, type or cat.)
 * 
 * cat {{filename}} will usually show the contents of a file, however it will not provide 
 * an extra carriage return at the end of the operation
